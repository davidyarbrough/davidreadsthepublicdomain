# David Reads the Public Domain

## Description
I want to get better at reading out loud, so I'm going to record myself 
reading a bunch of public domain works and put them on the internet.

The rules I'm setting for myself are as follows:

1. The work must be in the public domain
2. I will read each one in one take

Hopefully, with these rules, I will be able to actually publish something 
instead of trying to perfect everything before publishing anything. And 
by publishing in one take, I'll be able to track my progress and see if 
I'm actually getting better. I expect the first many videos to be... 
rough.

## Structure

Each directory corresponds to a single video. This may represent an entire 
work, or it may represent a chapter or other subdivision if I tackle longer 
works. each directory will contain the full text of the work read in that 
episode, as well as a metadata file that provides a link to the video of 
the reading, date of publishing, and contextual information such as the name 
of the author, original date of publishing, and anything else I think of 
later.
